# Chord Identifier Plugin for Musescore
- Identify chords and put chord symbol on top.
- Works with single or multiple voices, accross one or more staves (like in sheet music for piano).
- Inversions are indicated.
- Notes are colored according to their function in the chord:
	* Root in green
	* Third in brown
	* Seventh in red
- Works on whole sheet or on selected portion.
- Shows chords used in classical music: triads (major, minor, diminished) and seventh chords (MM7, m7, Mm7, dim7).<br/>

Note: Chord symbols are put in chord symbol text element (!), and the plugin can be run multiple times without texts fields being duplicated! (was not the case in other plugins)

<h3>Acknowledgment:</h3>
I started this plugin as an improvement of the "Find Harmonies" plugin by Andresn
	(https://github.com/andresn/standard-notation-experiments/tree/master/MuseScore/plugins/findharmonies)<br/>
	Itself being an enhanced version of "findharmony" by Merte (http://musescore.org/en/project/findharmony)<br/>
	<br/>
I took some lines of code or got inspiration from:
- Berteh (https://github.com/berteh/musescore-chordsToNotes/)
- Jon Ensminger (AddNoteNameNoteHeads v. 1.2 plugin)
